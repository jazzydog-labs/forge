# Forge Brainstorming Overview

This directory collects a series of early high level designs (HLDs) for **Forge**, a code generation framework that may incorporate AI agents. The goal is to outline possible architectures, repository layout, and key design principles.

These documents are exploratory and not final specifications. They attempt to sketch out approaches that could be evaluated and iterated upon.
