# Forge

Forge is a generative factory for producing project scaffolding and boilerplate. It is under heavy design and currently consists of brainstorming documents and prototypes.

See [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) for the planned command line interface. The
service-mode REST API is outlined in
[docs/design-rest-api.md](docs/design-rest-api.md). Communication with
Crucible via an event bus is described in
[docs/design-event-bus.md](docs/design-event-bus.md). Vault's read-only
artifact interface is covered in
[docs/design-vault-readonly.md](docs/design-vault-readonly.md).
